Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If **you want** to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, *you can* *create* new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

# Publication

Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you're happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms like **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **WordPress** and **Zendesk**. With [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/), you have full control over what you export.
